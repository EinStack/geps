# TITLE: Unified API

## Abstract

This GEP discusses the unified API that handles the interaction with LLM providers.

## Motivation

[TBU, what problem we are trying to solve, focus on users, use cases, and all important context]

The Unified API holds all the logic needed to create a request to a provider. This solution allows the clients to be easily
envoked by a provider pool.


### Requirements


R1: Should be a Hertz Client
R2: Should take a user request as input
R3: Handles all provider specific logic
R3: Easily maintained


## Design

[TBU, all information about the proposed solution, possibly evaluations against the requirements]

## Alternatives Considered

[TBU, what other solutions were considered and why they were rejected]

## Future Work

[TBU, what we put outside of the equation now, but may want to consider in the future]
