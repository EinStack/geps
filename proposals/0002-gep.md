# TITLE: Unified API

## Abstract

This GEP discusses the unified API that handles the interaction with LLM providers.

## Motivation

[TBU, what problem we are trying to solve, focus on users, use cases, and all important context]

The Unified API holds all the logic needed to create a request to a provider. This solution allows the clients to be easily
envoked by a provider pool.


### Requirements

R1: User should be able to specify specific models or select auto mode (selection handled by Glide)
R2: Should be a Hertz Client
R3: Should take a user request as input
R4: Handles all provider specific logic
R5: Easily maintained


## Design

[TBU, all information about the proposed solution, possibly evaluations against the requirements]

A Hertz client that handles an incoming request and returns a reponse from that provider.

## Example

User request calls for a fallback strategy of  OpenAI backed up by Anthropic. OpenAI is available so the OpenAI client is invoked and OpenAI reuqest is build from data in the user request plus any default nonspecified params.

## Reference

## Alternatives Considered

[TBU, what other solutions were considered and why they were rejected]

## Future Work

[TBU, what we put outside of the equation now, but may want to consider in the future]
