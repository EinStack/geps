# Service Config

## Abstract

Glide is going to have many configs that control both functional and non-functional aspect of the service work. 
This GEP defines how that config is going to be set, structured and maintained across the service lifetime.

## Motivation

Glide is a gateway that provides a bunch of configurations to set, manage, and maintain. 
This ensures flexibility needed to meet various needs of our end users.

For example:

- **Telemetry Configs**: Log Output Format, Min Log Level, OTEL Configs
- **HTTP Server Configs**: Is enabled?, IP and Port to bind, max body size, CORS, etc.
- **SSL/TLS Configs:** Ciphers, Cert Paths, etc.
- **LLM Provider Configs**: API Keys, Default Parameters, Timeouts, Connection Pool Configs, etc.
- **Routing and Load Balancing Configs**: Balancing Strategy, Routing Weights, Provider Pool Definitions, etc.
- **Caching Configs**: Redis Connection Configs, TTLs, etc.
- **gRPC Server Configs**: Is enabled?, IP and Port to bind, etc.
- etc.

The configuration may be versioned via git to track all changes. 
At the same time, some configs are sensitive data (notably, LLM API Keys) 
and it must not be provided directly in the config (otherwise, they would be leaked in git).

As any other config, users should be able to easily change and apply configs. 
Ideally, Glide should be able to automatically detect changes to the config and 
reload its internal representation together with the related state.

Finally, the more configs we expose, the harder may become to understand the overall config
and find the right setting to adjust. So the config structure is an important thing here to eliminate this fatigue.

### Requirements

- R1: Config format must be readable
- R2: Config format must allow comments
- R3: Config format must be `git diff`-able and versioned
- R4: Config must be easy to understand and reason about
- R5: Config must allow to include sensitive values from environment variables
- R6: Config may allow to include sensitive values from other plain files
- R7: Config should be auto-reloaded on change
