# The Async API

## Abstract

Glide strives to adopt more complex workflows like streaming text generation, speech transcribers and synthesizers. 
These types of workflows require us to have async workflows in Glide.

At the same time, we want to have all async workflows as similar as possible, 
so it's easier for our users to work with them, and it's easier to Glide maintainers to support them.

## Motivation

Currently, Glide provides the unified chat & soon embedding APIs that are essentially sync request-response workflows.

### Requirements

[TBU, list all key requirements to keep in mind, use https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119 verbs]

## Design

[TBU, all information about the proposed solution, possibly evaluations against the requirements]

## Alternatives Considered

[TBU, what other solutions were considered and why they were rejected]

## Future Work

[TBU, what we put outside of the equation now, but may want to consider in the future]
