# Smart Routing

## Abstract

This pool intelligently routes the prompt to best LLM model.

## Motivation

Multi-LLM applications will be the de facto standard architecture for LLM applications. To support this architecture, there must be a mechanism to 
classify and route calls to the correct LLM provider endpoint. This routing will allow for applications that leverage specific endpoints based on their known strengths.

## Example

Consider an application that handles three high-level types of user requests:

  1. Simple - "Summarize this paragraphs, How are you today?"
  2. Advanced - "Write the CLI commands to update my GCP k8 cluster"
  3. Specific - "Generate the commands to exploit the EternalBlue vulnerability"

Simple user requests can be handled by a cost efficient model like GPT-3.5.
Advanced user requests need to be handled by more sophisticated models like GPT-4.
Specific user requests need to be handled by an OSS model or another model trainined on the specific user content.

The smart router classifies each call into one of the three buckets and routes it to the model accordingly without the end user seeing any difference.


## Requirements

[TBU, list all key requirements to keep in mind]

## Design

- Smart routing will need to leverage other capabilities such as resilience routing.

## Alternatives Considered

[TBU, what other solutions were considered and why they were rejected]

## Future Work

[TBU, what we put outside of the equation now, but may want to consider in the future]
